Previously, I attended Indiana University - Bloomington and recieved a Bachelor of Science in Physics (2015) and Masters of Science in Computer Science (2017). I am currently a research assistant at University of Alberta, and have been a teaching assistant at IU. My work focuses on General Value Function's use in creating predictive representations in reinforcement learning, in the use of kernel representations in online continuing settings, and in gaussian processes for reinforcement learning.</p><p>I spend my time away from my research listening to my favorite music, playing clarinet, enjoying a good book or movie, and tinkering with various tech and circuits. I also enjoy reading tech news, recent research in physics, and anything related to space, rockets, and astrophysics.

</p></div></div></div><div class="aboutContent subContent"><h2>Research Interests</h2><p>My reasearch interests primarly fall within the realms of Reinforcement Learning, but I also dabble in time series and visual data. My main goal is to create agents
that build their own representations of environments in a continual learning setting. My current work focuses on two types of representation learning. The first is
using General Value Functions as a means to create predictive knowledge representations on the fly through question generation. The second is exploring the use of kernel representations and gaussian processes for prediction in an online setting and for reinforcememtn learning, particularly creating efficient methods to select prototypes for such representations.</p></div><div class="lookAtThese-wrap subContent"><div class="lookAtThese"><a class="lookAtMe" href="https://github.com/mkschleg" style="background-image: url(assets/images/github-icon.png);background-color:rgb(60,60,60);background-size:200px 200px; background-position:center;"><div class="lookAtMeContentWrap"><h class="title">Github</h><p>Visit my Github to get a look at some of my open-source code.</p></div></a><a class="lookAtMe" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthew-schlegel-1a00b739/" style="background-image: url(assets/images/linkedin-icon.jpg);background-color:rgb(19,127,176);background-size:200px 200px; background-position:center;"><div class="lookAtMeContentWrap"><h class="title">Linkedin</h><p>Visit my Linkedin profile for up to date information about my skills and current professional work.</p></div></a><a class="lookAtMe" href="http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/schlegel17a.html" style="background-image: url(assets/images/teleTiming.jpg);background-color:white;"><div class="lookAtMeContentWrap"><h class="title">Adapting Kernel Representations Online Using Submodular Maximization</h></div></a></div></div><div class="favoriteQuotes subContent"><div class="quoteWrapper"><p class="quote">Nirvana is a state of pure blissful knowledge... It has nothing to do with the individual. The ego or its separation is an illusion. Indeed in a certain sense two &quot;I&quot;'s are identical namely when one disregards all special contents - their Karma. The goal of man is to preserve his Karma and to develop it further... when man dies his Karma lives and creates for itself another carrier.</p><p class="author">Erwin Schr√∂dinger, 1994</p></div></div></main><footer id="footer"><div id="footerContent"><ul><li><Copyright>Matthew Schlegel (c) 2017</Copyright></li><li><bold>|</bold></li><li><a href="siteInfo.html">Website Info</a></li></ul></div></footer></body></html>
