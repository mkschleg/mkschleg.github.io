      <description>&lt;p&gt;So why am I starting a blog? And what is it going to be about? These are great questions, and hopefully this post will act as a launching pad for the content that will eventually be found here. Instead of having a long rant up front, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer a bunch of questions you may have and you can easily skip sections if they are uninteresting.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;who-the-heck-are-you&#34;&gt;Who the heck are you?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Well. I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I&amp;rsquo;ve found my way here through my current advisor, Martha White, who was initially an assistant professor (on tenure track) at Indiana University. I met her when I was finishing my first graduate degree in computer science at the now School of Informatics, Computing, and Engineering (SOIC when I was enrolled). I also have had the pleasure of working with Martha and her husband (who was a post-doc at IU and now a research scientist at the Edmonton Deep Mind office) in machine learning and reinforcement learning. I worked on many projects, mostly related to discovery of prototypes or predictions for representations (see my published works page!) and was offered a chance to continue my education at UofA when Martha was offered a position.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
