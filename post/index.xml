      <description>This weekend we&amp;mdash;my partner, Jess, and me&amp;mdash;made a trip to a small town between Calgary and Banff: Canmore, AB. Looking for relaxation, inspiration, and fresh brisk air, we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the great food and drink scene that Canmore has to offer two self-proclaimed foodies looking for a weekend getaway. Among the high achievers was our first stop, Rave Coffee. We loved the coffee and atmosphere on our first visit so much that I find myself writing this post while enjoying an espresso and pour over on our way out of town.</description>

      <description>Ok. Look. I procrastinate. I procrastinate a lot. I have a reasonably sized talk tomorrow at Startup Edmonton (you should come! Details found here!), of which I have yet to finish, let alone practice. So instead of doing that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to come and enjoy the ritual of an espresso at Credo Coffee. I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of my choices, but they are the choices that get made (either by me or at the whims of some biological process).</description>

      <title>Why am I blogging?</title>

      <description>So why am I starting a blog? And what is it going to be about? These are great questions, and hopefully this post will act as a launching pad for the content that will eventually be found here. Instead of having a long rant up front, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer a bunch of questions you may have and you can easily skip sections if they are uninteresting.
Who the heck are you?</description>
