      <description>tags R:Thinking, R:Note-Taking source How to Take Smart Notes With Org-mode | blog  This is a blog about how the author of org-roam (Jethro Kuan) takes notes and utilizes org-roam to organize his thinking.
&amp;ldquo;Note-taking is Not Just a Precursor to Writing&amp;rdquo;
Quote from R:Richard Feynman : &amp;ldquo;Notes aren&amp;rsquo;t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.&amp;rdquo;
Process of writing:
 Find topic/research question Research/find literature Read and take notes Draw conclusions/ outline text Write  This suggests writing is linear, but infact research and writing are non-linear processes with all these ideas taking place together.</description>

      <description>tags R:Note-Taking  This is a method for note taking developed by Niklas Luhmann. There are several principles under which the method derives it&amp;rsquo;s workflow:
 Your notes should be atomic: This means topics should be placed into a single note, butthe scope of the topic should be small. This makes it easier to link and categorize throughout your notes. Your notes (or collection of notes) should be interconnected: This means you should continually make connections with notes previously written and place new notes into this structure.</description>

      <description>tags Philosophy, Brain, Perception  Sign theory is a theory of perception developed by Hermann von Helmholtz of how the brain processes and propagates information (i.e. a theory of perception). The main contribution of the theory is that stimuli present themselves as signals and those signals are modified as they propagate forward. The mind makes a series of &amp;ldquo;unconscious inferences&amp;rdquo;, or mental adjustments, to construct a &amp;ldquo;picture&amp;rdquo; of the experience.</description>

      <description>tags Linear Algebra, Math  We star with a set of equations with nine coefficients, three unknowns, and three right-hand sides.
\begin{align*} 2u + v + w &amp;amp;= 5 \\\
4u - 6v &amp;amp;=-2 \\\
-2u + 7v + 2w &amp;amp;=9 \end{align*}
We represent the right hand side with a column vector (or a 1 by 3 matrix). The unknowns of the system are represented as a column vector as well.</description>

      <title>Raving for Rave Coffee</title>

      <description>This weekend we&amp;mdash;my partner, Jess, and me&amp;mdash;made a trip to a small town between Calgary and Banff: Canmore, AB. Looking for relaxation, inspiration, and fresh brisk air, we didn&amp;rsquo;t expect the great food and drink scene that Canmore has to offer two self-proclaimed foodies looking for a weekend getaway. Among the high achievers was our first stop, Rave Coffee. We loved the coffee and atmosphere on our first visit so much that I find myself writing this post while enjoying an espresso and pour over on our way out of town.</description>

      <description>Ok. Look. I procrastinate. I procrastinate a lot. I have a reasonably sized talk tomorrow at Startup Edmonton (you should come! Details found here!), of which I have yet to finish, let alone practice. So instead of doing that I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to come and enjoy the ritual of an espresso at Credo Coffee. I&amp;rsquo;m not proud of my choices, but they are the choices that get made (either by me or at the whims of some biological process).</description>

      <title>Why am I blogging?</title>

      <description>So why am I starting a blog? And what is it going to be about? These are great questions, and hopefully this post will act as a launching pad for the content that will eventually be found here. Instead of having a long rant up front, I&amp;rsquo;m going to answer a bunch of questions you may have and you can easily skip sections if they are uninteresting.
Who the heck are you?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a PhD student at University of Alberta in Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. I have a BS in Physics and an MS in Computer Science both from Indiana University Bloomington. My current PhD work is focused on reinforcement learning, and specifically in understanding how agents may perceive their world. I focus primarily on prediction making, but have been known to dabble in control from time-to-time. My active research interests include: predictions as a component in intelligence (both artificial and biological), off-policy prediction and policy evaluation, deep learning and resulting learned representations in the reinforcement learning context, and discovery or attention of important abstractions (described as predictions) through interaction.</description>
