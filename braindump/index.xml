      <description>tags Thinking, Note-Taking source How to Take Smart Notes With Org-mode | blog  This is a blog about how the author of org-roam (Jethro Kuan) takes notes and utilizes org-roam to organize his thinking.
&amp;ldquo;Note-taking is Not Just a Precursor to Writing&amp;rdquo;
Quote from Richard Feynman : &amp;ldquo;Notes aren&amp;rsquo;t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.&amp;rdquo;
Process of writing:
 Find topic/research question Research/find literature Read and take notes Draw conclusions/ outline text Write  This suggests writing is linear, but infact research and writing are non-linear processes with all these ideas taking place together.</description>

      <description>tags Perception, Brain In this chapter, Prinz goes over evidence suggesting a shared coding between action and perception. He lays out empirical and theoretical evidence for a shared coding, and criticism for the separate coding approach. This is more directly linked to the Ideomotor Principle, and is some good evidence for having perception being dependent or apart of the behavioral responses.
  Separate Coding This view holds that the afferent and efferent codes are incommensurate at all levels of the coding.</description>

      <description>tags Predictive Processing, Perception source https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/behavioral-and-brain-sciences/article/whatever-next-predictive-brains-situated-agents-and-the-future-of-cognitive-science/33542C736E17E3D1D44E8D03BE5F4CD9  Clark argues for the notion that brains are prediction machines. They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is inspired by the work of (Rao 1999) and others in developing the brain as a inference machine.

      <description>tags Predictive Processing, Brain source https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2010.00025/full  This paper acts as an introduction to the vast literature considering the brain as a predictive processing machine. Specifically, it is looking at terms which have been introduced such as prediction, prospection, anticipation, expectation, preparation, as well as violations of expectations or prediction errors. All these terms have different nuances and levels of abstraction associated with human behavior, and should be treated separately.</description>

      <description>tags Note-Taking source zettelkasten.de  This is a method for note taking developed by Niklas Luhmann. There are several principles under which the method derives it&amp;rsquo;s workflow:
 Your notes should be atomic: This means topics should be placed into a single note, butthe scope of the topic should be small. This makes it easier to link and categorize throughout your notes. Your notes (or collection of notes) should be interconnected: This means you should continually make connections with notes previously written and place new notes into this structure.</description>

      <description>tags Linear Algebra, Math  Elimination is all about solving linear equations (which is central to linear algebra generally). As an example we have two equations with two unknowns
\begin{align*} 1x + 2y = 3 \\\
4x + 5y = 6 \end{align*} (from [[file:../linear_algebra_and_its_applications.org][Linear Algebra and its Applications]])
To solve for the unknowns $x$ and $y$ we can use elimination:
  subtract 4 times the first equation from the second equation (eliminates $x$ from the second equation)</description>

      <description>Backlinks 3 Backlinks Whatever next? Predictive brains, situated agents, and the future of cognitive science This work by brown2011generalizes the basic Hierarchical Predictive Coding model to include action. The fundamental attraction of these accounts lies in their ability to offer a deeply unified account of perception, cognition, and action.
The strategy of using top-down connections to try to generate, using high-level knowledge, a kind of &amp;ldquo;virtual version&amp;rdquo; of the sensory data via a deep multilevel cascade lies at the heart of Hierarchical Predictive Coding rao1999.</description>

Discovered by Porta in 1593 (Wade 1996). The essence is the interplay of perception with vision when you separate the visual stimuli of each eye. Each eye is presented with a separate image with a partition separating the effective visual field. A continuous cycle of the two images being recognizable (each in its own turn) with brief periods of mixed forms appearing.</description>

 They test for invertibility. If the determinant of A is zero, then A is singular. If the determinant is non-zero than the matrix can be inverted, meaning there is at least one solution to the set of equations. The determinant of a matrix is the volume of a box in n-dimensional space.</description>
